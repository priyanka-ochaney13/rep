- **Fit to Screen** (⛶): Automatically scale diagram to 90% for optimal viewing

### 2. **Pan/Drag Functionality**

## 📦 Technical Implementation

### New Dependencies
```json
"html-to-image": "^1.11.11"
```

### Component Structure
```
ArchitectureTab
  └── DiagramCard (New Component)
      ├── Zoom Controls
      ├── Pan Functionality
      ├── Export Handler
      └── Fullscreen Toggle
```

### State Management
Each diagram card maintains its own state:
- `scale`: Current zoom level (0.5 - 3.0)
- `position`: Pan position {x, y}
- `isDragging`: Drag state for smooth interactions
- `isFullscreen`: Fullscreen mode toggle
- `isExporting`: Export process indicator

## 🔧 Code Changes

### Files Modified
1. **frontend/src/pages/RepoDocs.jsx**
   - Added `useRef` import for DOM manipulation
   - Imported `toPng` from html-to-image
   - Created new `DiagramCard` component
   - Refactored ArchitectureTab to use DiagramCard

2. **frontend/src/pages/RepoDocs.css**
   - Added `.diagram-card-header` styles
   - Added `.diagram-controls` and `.control-btn` styles
   - Added `.mermaid-container-enhanced` for better diagram display
   - Added `.diagram-hints` for user guidance
   - Added fullscreen mode styles

3. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added html-to-image dependency

## 🎮 Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Zoom**: Use zoom buttons or mouse wheel
2. **Pan**: Click and drag the diagram to reposition
3. **Reset View**: Click the reset button to return to default
4. **Export**: Click the PNG button to download the diagram
5. **Fullscreen**: Click the fullscreen button for larger view

### For Developers
```jsx
// The DiagramCard component handles each diagram independently
<DiagramCard 
  title="Component Hierarchy"
  diagramText={mermaidDiagramString}
  diagramError={errorState}
  diagramKey="component_hierarchy"
  index={0}
/>
```

## 🚀 Performance Considerations
- Event listeners properly cleaned up on unmount
- Passive: false for wheel events to prevent scrolling
- Transitions disabled during drag for smooth performance
- High-quality PNG export with 2x pixel ratio
- Debounced zoom operations to prevent jank

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future versions:
- Pinch-to-zoom for touch devices
- Double-click to reset zoom
- Minimap for large diagrams
- SVG export option
- Multiple export formats (PDF, SVG, PNG)
- Keyboard shortcuts (+ for zoom in, - for zoom out)
- Touch gesture support for mobile devices

## 📝 Notes
- The component maintains backward compatibility
- Error states are preserved and displayed
- All diagrams use the same dark theme (#0b1625)
- Export quality set to maximum for production use
- Controls are accessible and keyboard-friendly
